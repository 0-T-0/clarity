<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6>Updated to TypeScript 2.0 and Angular 2.2.0</h6>
        <p>
            With the 0.7.1 release, Clarity has been updated to the latest
            versions of Angular and Typescript.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Documentation improvements on website</h6>
        <p>
            In response to requests from the community, the Clarity team
            updated the layout and design of the documentation section of the
            website. We're hoping these improvements make our research and
            code examples easier to read and navigate.
